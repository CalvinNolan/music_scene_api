== Music Scene Playlist Generation API

This is the repository for the TCD CS3013/CS2013 Group 34 project.

It will be an API that, given a location and optionally a genre, will generate a playlist of songsfrom Spotify and Soundcloud of new music and upcoming artists in that location with the aim of giving a taste of the music scene in that location.
